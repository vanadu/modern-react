  To get this to work we need to create the interface between React and Redux so they can communicate with each other.

  // !VA Step 1: First we need to do is get some state out of our redux store that is defined below here and show some state or show some property inside of our counter component. So to do so I'm going to define a mapStateToProps function. The count variable and its behavior is defined there, so all we are doing here is exposing it to the component for use as props. To do this, we're creating an object called count and assigning it the count property from state. By returning that to the component, the the count object now becomes available to the component as props.
  const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
    return { count: state.count }
  }

  // !VA Step 2: Pass the mapStateToProps function as the first argument to the RR Connect function.
  // !VA Step 5: Pass the action creators defined above in the second argument of the connect function as an object.
  const WrappedCounter = ReactRedux.connect(mapStateToProps, {
    // increment: increment,
    // decrement: decrement
    // !VA And don't forget that if the object key and value are identical, in ES6 we can reduce them a single value
    increment,
    decrement
  })(Counter);




  // Only change code *before* me!
  // -----------

  const store = Redux.createStore(Redux.combineReducers({
    // !VA Step 5: To test up to step 4, Confirm that we're getting data from the Redux store by changing count here.  
    // count: (count = 10, action) => {
    count: (count = 0, action) => {
      if (action.type === 'increment') {
        return count + 1;
      } else if (action.type === 'decrement') {
        return count - 1;
      } else {
        return count;
      }
    }
  }));
